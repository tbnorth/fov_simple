// 
// These working examples, complete with fully commented code, illustrate a few
// ways in which this plugin can be used.

// 
// About: Support and Testing
// 
// Information about what version or versions of jQuery this plugin has been
// tested with, what browsers it has been tested in, and where the unit tests
// reside (so you can test it yourself).
// 
// jQuery Versions - 1.2.6, 1.3.2, 1.4.1, 1.4.2
// Browsers Tested - Internet Explorer 6-8, Firefox 2-4, Chrome 5-6, Safari 3.2-5,
//                   Opera 9.6-10.60, iPhone 3.1, Android 1.6-2.2, BlackBerry 4.6-5.
// Unit Tests      - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/unit/
// 
// About: Known issues
// 
// While this jQuery hashchange event implementation is quite stable and
// robust, there are a few unfortunate browser bugs surrounding expected
// hashchange event-based behaviors, independent of any JavaScript
// window.onhashchange abstraction. See the following examples for more
// information:
//

// 
// About: Release History
// 
// 1.3   - (7/21/2010) Reorganized IE6/7 Iframe code to make it more
//         "removable" for mobile-only development. Added IE6/7 document.title
//         support. Attempted to make Iframe as hidden as possible by using
//         techniques from http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=604. Added 
//         support for the "shortcut" format $(window).hashchange( fn ) and
//         $(window).hashchange() like jQuery provides for built-in events.
//         Renamed jQuery.hashchangeDelay to <jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay> and
//         lowered its default value to 50. Added <jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain>
//         and <jQuery.fn.hashchange.src> properties plus document-domain.html
//         file to address access denied issues when setting document.domain in
//         IE6/7.
// 1.2   - (2/11/2010) Fixed a bug where coming back to a page using this plugin
//         from a page on another domain would cause an error in Safari 4. Also,
//         IE6/7 Iframe is now inserted after the body (this actually works),
//         which prevents the page from scrolling when the event is first bound.
//         Event can also now be bound before DOM ready, but it won't be usable
//         before then in IE6/7.
// 1.1   - (1/21/2010) Incorporated document.documentMode test to fix IE8 bug
//         where browser version is incorrectly reported as 8.0, despite
//         inclusion of the X-UA-Compatible IE=EmulateIE7 meta tag.
// 1.0   - (1/9/2010) Initial Release. Broke out the jQuery BBQ event.special
//         window.onhashchange functionality into a separate plugin for users
//         who want just the basic event & back button support, without all the
//         extra awesomeness that BBQ provides. This plugin will be included as
//         part of jQuery BBQ, but also be available separately.

  // Method: jQuery.fn.hashchange
  // 
  // Bind a handler to the window.onhashchange event or trigger all bound
  // window.onhashchange event handlers. This behavior is consistent with
  // jQuery's built-in event handlers.
  // 
  // Usage:
  // 
  // > jQuery(window).hashchange( [ handler ] );
  // 
  // Arguments:
  // 
  //  handler - (Function) Optional handler to be bound to the hashchange
  //    event. This is a "shortcut" for the more verbose form:
  //    jQuery(window).bind( 'hashchange', handler ). If handler is omitted,
  //    all bound window.onhashchange event handlers will be triggered. This
  //    is a shortcut for the more verbose
  //    jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' ). These forms are described in
  //    the <hashchange event> section.
  // 
  // Returns:
  // 
  //  (jQuery) The initial jQuery collection of elements.
  
  // Allow the "shortcut" format $(elem).hashchange( fn ) for binding and
  // $(elem).hashchange() for triggering, like jQuery does for built-in events.
  $.fn[ str_hashchange ] = function( fn ) {
    return fn ? this.bind( str_hashchange, fn ) : this.trigger( str_hashchange );
  };
  
  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay
  // 
  // The numeric interval (in milliseconds) at which the <hashchange event>
  // polling loop executes. Defaults to 50.
  
  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain
  // 
  // If you're setting document.domain in your JavaScript, and you want hash
  // history to work in IE6/7, not only must this property be set, but you must
  // also set document.domain BEFORE jQuery is loaded into the page. This
  // property is only applicable if you are supporting IE6/7 (or IE8 operating
  // in "IE7 compatibility" mode).
  // 
  // In addition, the <jQuery.fn.hashchange.src> property must be set to the
  // path of the included "document-domain.html" file, which can be renamed or
  // modified if necessary (note that the document.domain specified must be the
  // same in both your main JavaScript as well as in this file).
  // 
  // Usage:
  // 
  // jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain = document.domain;
  
  // Property: jQuery.fn.hashchange.src
  // 
  // If, for some reason, you need to specify an Iframe src file (for example,
  // when setting document.domain as in <jQuery.fn.hashchange.domain>), you can
  // do so using this property. Note that when using this property, history
  // won't be recorded in IE6/7 until the Iframe src file loads. This property
  // is only applicable if you are supporting IE6/7 (or IE8 operating in "IE7
  // compatibility" mode).
  // 
  // Usage:
  // 
  // jQuery.fn.hashchange.src = 'path/to/file.html';

  /*
  $.fn[ str_hashchange ].domain = null;
  $.fn[ str_hashchange ].src = null;
  */
  
  // Event: hashchange event
  // 
  // Fired when location.hash changes. In browsers that support it, the native
  // HTML5 window.onhashchange event is used, otherwise a polling loop is
  // initialized, running every <jQuery.fn.hashchange.delay> milliseconds to
  // see if the hash has changed. In IE6/7 (and IE8 operating in "IE7
  // compatibility" mode), a hidden Iframe is created to allow the back button
  // and hash-based history to work.
  // 
  // Usage as described in <jQuery.fn.hashchange>:
  // 
  // > // Bind an event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).hashchange( function(e) {
  // >   var hash = location.hash;
  // >   ...
  // > });
  // > 
  // > // Manually trigger the event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).hashchange();
  // 
  // A more verbose usage that allows for event namespacing:
  // 
  // > // Bind an event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).bind( 'hashchange', function(e) {
  // >   var hash = location.hash;
  // >   ...
  // > });
  // > 
  // > // Manually trigger the event handler.
  // > jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' );
  // 
  // Additional Notes:
  // 
  // * The polling loop and Iframe are not created until at least one handler
  //   is actually bound to the 'hashchange' event.
  // * If you need the bound handler(s) to execute immediately, in cases where
  //   a location.hash exists on page load, via bookmark or page refresh for
  //   example, use jQuery(window).hashchange() or the more verbose 
  //   jQuery(window).trigger( 'hashchange' ).
  // * The event can be bound before DOM ready, but since it won't be usable
  //   before then in IE6/7 (due to the necessary Iframe), recommended usage is
  //   to bind it inside a DOM ready handler.
  
  // Override existing $.event.special.hashchange methods (allowing this plugin
  // to be defined after jQuery BBQ in BBQ's source code).

			// a touch event, even though the target of the touchstart/touchend event
			// says the user touched outside the link. Also, it seems that with most
			// browsers, the target of the mouse/click event is not calculated until the
			// time it is dispatched, so if you replace an element that you touched
			// with another element, the target of the mouse/click will be the new
			// element underneath that point.
			//
			// Aside from proximity, we also check to see if the target and any
			// of its ancestors were the ones that blocked a click. This is necessary
			// because of the strange mouse/click target calculation done in the
			// Android 2.1 browser, where if you click on an element, and there is a
